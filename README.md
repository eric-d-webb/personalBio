# Hey, my name is Eric.

This is where I'll be putting the silly little programs I develop as I continue to make myself a better programmer.
I'm a huge game enthusiast, which is what sprung me into this wider field. I've dabbled in mods for The Binding of Isaac Rebirth.

Currently proficient in C/C++, rusty in Java.
