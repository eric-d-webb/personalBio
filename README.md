# Hey, my name is Eric.

This is where I'll be putting the silly little programs I develop as I continue to make myself a better programmer.
I'm a huge game enthusiast, which is what sprung me into this wider field. I've dabbled in mods for The Binding of Isaac Rebirth, but haven't done much with it sense as I've continued my education. My page won't be this barren for long, let me assure you.

Currently proficient in C/C++, rusty in Java.
